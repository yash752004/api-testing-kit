# API Testing Kit - Implementation Tasks

This file is the execution plan for building the project in parallel.

The goal is to let multiple subagents work at the same time with minimal overlap:
- one track owns the app shell and design system
- one track owns the guest-authenticated workspace
- one track owns backend APIs and persistence
- one track owns security, rate limiting, and request execution
- one track owns public pages and product docs
- one optional later track owns monetization and entitlement groundwork
- one track owns deployment and test infrastructure

All tasks below are aligned with `plan.md`, `ui-pages.md`, and `design-guideline.md`.

---

## Work Rules

- Do not start feature work before the shared scaffold exists.
- Do not let multiple agents edit the same file unless the task explicitly says so.
- Treat the database schema, route map, and design tokens as shared contracts.
- Keep guest mode on `/app` limited by backend rules, not only UI state.
- Prefer small, independently mergeable changes.

### Assumed Post-Scaffold Ownership Slices

Adapt these to the scaffold you create, but keep ownership boundaries similar:

- `apps/web`: SvelteKit routes, layouts, load functions, and marketing pages
- `server/cmd/api` and `server/internal`: Go backend modules, auth, runner, rate limiting, and admin endpoints
- `apps/web/src/lib` or a future `packages/ui`: shared app shell, themed components, and UI primitives
- `schema.sql`, `goose` migrations, and any future Go data layer: schema, migrations, seeders, query helpers
- `infra` or deployment folder: Docker, Compose, CI, deployment scripts

---

## Parallel Execution Map

These tracks can run at the same time after the blockers are in place:

- `Agent Group A`: design system, app shell, marketing shell
- `Agent Group B`: guest gating, request builder, response viewer, templates UI
- `Agent Group C`: DB layer, auth, collections, history, templates API, abuse storage
- `Agent Group D`: runner, SSRF, guest restrictions, rate limiting, abuse hooks
- `Agent Group E`: optional monetization, entitlement storage, billing scaffolding
- `Agent Group F`: landing page, docs, features, case study
- `Agent Group G`: Docker, CI, deployment, test harness

The only hard blockers are:
- BL1 scaffold
- BL2 schema
- BL3 route/app contract

After those are in place, the rest can proceed in parallel with careful file ownership.

---

## Suggested Merge Order

1. Merge scaffold, schema, and route contract.
2. Merge design system and shell.
3. Merge backend base APIs and DB wiring.
4. Merge guest workspace UI and response viewer.
5. Merge request runner, SSRF, and rate limits.
6. Merge collections/history/templates.
7. Merge marketing pages and docs.
8. Merge deployment and test infrastructure.
9. Merge optional monetization groundwork, only if it is in scope.

---

## Definition Of Done

The implementation phase is done when:
- `/app` works in guest and authenticated modes
- requests can be sent safely from the backend
- collections and history are persisted
- abuse protection and rate limits are active
- the UI matches the approved design system
- the app can be built and deployed locally with Docker
- the task list supports multiple subagents without overlapping ownership
